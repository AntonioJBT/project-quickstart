'''
setup for |project_name|

For example on setting a Python package, see:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html
https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject

For Python 3.5
Before packaging or installing run:

    pip install -U pip twine check-manifest setuptools

TO DO: to add tests see https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing.html

To package, do something like this:

    check-manifest
    python setup.py check
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheels

which will create a dist/ directory and a compressed file inside with your package.

More notes and references in:
    https://github.com/EpiCompBio/welcome

And in the Python docs.
Upload to PyPI after this if for general use.
