    A description of your project
    Links to the project's ReadTheDocs page
    A TravisCI button showing the state of the build
    "Quickstart" documentation (how to quickly install and use your project)
    A list of non-Python dependencies (if any) and how to install them

In progress...

Boilerplate tools and templates for setting up a data analysis project. The package is setup with: 
- reproducibility concepts in mind
- Ruffus_ as a pipeline tool and CGAT_ tools for support 
- Python_ programming and packaging_
- restructuredText_ and Sphinx_ for reporting
- Travis_ and tox_ for testing
- Conda_ and Docker_ for management and development
- GitHub_ for version control

I've additionally put some basic instructions/reminders to link GitHub with:
- ReadtheDocs_
- Zenodo_ (for archiving your code and generating a DOI)
- Travis CI.

I discovered CookieCutter_ while working on this. It does what I have setup here better, with useful features, flexibility and many templates for different types of projects.

Also see its data-science_ and reproducibility_ templates, they look good.
